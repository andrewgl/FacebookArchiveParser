NuixContent: Help needed!
To all my Canberra friends,
two friends of mine are moving to canberra in two weeks. They need a place to live for the first two months whilst they get acquainted with Canberra and work out where they want to live and find an house. They are public servants, in the mid 30&#039;s  both finishing their masters and hail from Sydney. 
They are not looking for a house to move in to permanently, just a place for a few months. The first week they will live in my floor as I don&#039;t have a second bedroom but since they mean the world to me, I want to help them out as much as I can. 
So if YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW is looking for a short-term flatmate or have a spare room and want to make a little extra cash for a few months from mid feb, let me know.
If you can&#039;t help, still keep your ears open, if you hear of something, let me know as well.
Thanks and I hope everyone&#039;s summer is going well. If you are a teacher, enjoy your last week of freedom!
Rou
