NuixContent: Dear Friends,
About a month ago I committed to the 9km Bridge Run with CanToo on 16 September to support Cure Cancer Australia and Cancer research. Those of you who know me well will know this isn&#039;t the greatest distance for me; however the challenge to fundraise a minimum of $800 is something new. I&#039;m halfway through the 10 weeks of training now, and it&#039;s time to get the $$ flowing. 
I&#039;ll spare you the &#039;we&#039;ve all been touched by cancer&#039; jazz, it&#039;s almost become an understatement these days. Basically, I&#039;m fundraising, I&#039;d love any help you could swing my way for a great cause, and karma will do the rest.
Here&#039;s my fundraising page:http://cantoobsrf2012.gofundraise.com.au/page/RachaelChadwick
And if you&#039;d like more info on CanToo and Cure Cancer Australia, have a look here:

NuixContent: Help needed!
To all my Canberra friends,
two friends of mine are moving to canberra in two weeks. They need a place to live for the first two months whilst they get acquainted with Canberra and work out where they want to live and find an house. They are public servants, in the mid 30&#039;s  both finishing their masters and hail from Sydney. 
They are not looking for a house to move in to permanently, just a place for a few months. The first week they will live in my floor as I don&#039;t have a second bedroom but since they mean the world to me, I want to help them out as much as I can. 
So if YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW is looking for a short-term flatmate or have a spare room and want to make a little extra cash for a few months from mid feb, let me know.
If you can&#039;t help, still keep your ears open, if you hear of something, let me know as well.
Thanks and I hope everyone&#039;s summer is going well. If you are a teacher, enjoy your last week of freedom!
Rou

Hi Robbie,

This is the bierbike tour I mentioned which might be fun for the buck&#039;s party http://www.bierbike-berlin.de/fileadmin/berlin/Dateien/bierbike_english.pdf

As he has outlived people who cut their own ears, were forced to commit suicide by their petty dictatorial boyfriend or crucified, he would like to go celebrate on Saturday 14th of June. You have all made the list of people whom he likes to drink, eat, laugh and be merry. So come do that! We were thinking about having dinner at 7 pm Francisco&#039;s in Manuka http://www.franciscos.com.au/menu.php (its Mexican food and it has some vegetarian options although not many) Then we want to go have drinks at Polit bar which we stumbled upon a few weeks ago and fell in love with http://www.politbar.co/ If you would like to come for part or all of that evening, let me know so I can book a table. We hope to see you there, Rou
