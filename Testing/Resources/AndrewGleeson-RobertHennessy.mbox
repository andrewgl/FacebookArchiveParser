NuixContent: hey, em asked me to forward the following to you.  But I dont know your email!  Here&#039;s hoping you get this...
Hi Robbie,
This is the walking tour I was talking about, it is awesome. Don&#039;t make the mistake of going on the free one as it is boring! http://www.brewersberlintours.com/
This is the bierbike tour I mentioned which might be fun for the buck&#039;s party http://www.bierbike-berlin.de/fileadmin/berlin/Dateien/bierbike_english.pdf
Don&#039;t forget to remind us of when your 30th birthday is so we can come down.
Em
