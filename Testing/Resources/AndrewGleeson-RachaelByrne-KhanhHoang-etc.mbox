NuixContent: Dear Friends,
About a month ago I committed to the 9km Bridge Run with CanToo on 16 September to support Cure Cancer Australia and Cancer research. Those of you who know me well will know this isn&#039;t the greatest distance for me; however the challenge to fundraise a minimum of $800 is something new. I&#039;m halfway through the 10 weeks of training now, and it&#039;s time to get the $$ flowing. 
I&#039;ll spare you the &#039;we&#039;ve all been touched by cancer&#039; jazz, it&#039;s almost become an understatement these days. Basically, I&#039;m fundraising, I&#039;d love any help you could swing my way for a great cause, and karma will do the rest.
Here&#039;s my fundraising page:http://cantoobsrf2012.gofundraise.com.au/page/RachaelChadwick
And if you&#039;d like more info on CanToo and Cure Cancer Australia, have a look here:

Big love,
