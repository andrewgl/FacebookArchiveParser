NuixContent: Dear all, Dan is turning 34, he has outlived people who died at 33 like Van Gogh, Eva Braun and of course Jesus. As he has outlived people who cut their own ears, were forced to commit suicide by their petty dictatorial boyfriend or crucified, he would like to go celebrate on Saturday 14th of June. You have all made the list of people whom he likes to drink, eat, laugh and be merry. So come do that! We were thinking about having dinner at 7 pm Francisco&#039;s in Manuka http://www.franciscos.com.au/menu.php (its Mexican food and it has some vegetarian options although not many) Then we want to go have drinks at Polit bar which we stumbled upon a few weeks ago and fell in love with http://www.politbar.co/ If you would like to come for part or all of that evening, let me know so I can book a table. We hope to see you there, Rou
