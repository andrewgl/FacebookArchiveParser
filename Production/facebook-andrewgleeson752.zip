damian, listen I cant really talk to you at the moment.  I can&#039;t believe how you fucked this up, and i have no idea how you could fix it.  Even if you wanted to, which all your bullshit justification indicates to the negative.

I mean, just think about the consequences of your little bitchburst...no we are not coming to xmas, and sorry bud you won&#039;t be at my graduation.  So you tell me, what other family events will you or emma have to miss? 

And you have no idea what you are talking about, I mean honestly you haven&#039;t spent 1 week with emma and me over the last 2 years?  What the fuck have you directly seen??  You really feel like you know us well enough to make those shitty judgements?

Listen, Im sick of seeing these pointless messages on my facebook.  I asked you not to write back re this and you ignored me.  If you want to talk about it you can get my mobile number. 

thanks for the fucking birthday wishes.

Happy Birthday Bro!
 
I know we have a lot to talk about, which we will, but wanted to say Happy Bday anyway.
 
I absolutely do apologise for any pain I&#039;ve caused you and Emma, it honestly wasnt my intention.
 
I talked to the rest of the family about this, as they all knew about it anyway.
 
I honestly dont hate Emma.

I was only concerned for you, based on things I have directly seen for myself, but it did turn out badly, and for that I really do apologise.
 
Cant express how disappointed that youre not coming to Adelaide, but anyway click on the link to see who&#039;s the best bowler in my division...

bro.  To answer one of your questions, choosing facebook or the internet to deal with such things as this is the worst way to do so.  Thats because you have no control over who reads what you&#039;ve written.  So yeah, I have the tablet that em and I both use set up so that notifications for both our email accounts, and facebook messages, get displayed automatically.  So yeah em read that message...could&#039;nt not read it actually...and you have hurt her incredibly.  

She loves you dude, and she had no idea you felt that way.  I had some idea, from some implications you made casually. I didnt like those implications btw, I wish I had said something cause maybe you wouldn&#039;t have written this. But never mind me you have hurt em so bad I doubt she will ever be able to talk to you again.    Don&#039;t know what you can do about that.  Will probably end up keeping us brothers apart in future I imagine.

Damian, nothing you said was justified. Do you really know so little about our relationship? But as you say you arent embarrassed about saying this stuff.  I actually have no idea how to respond to your message, you don&#039;t seem to have much respect for me.  You feel I let em walk all over me?  You feel I let her make all the important decisions for us?  You think Im putting my career second because em tells me to?  You compared her to helen??? You think she is bad for me?  After all the positive influences em has had on my life??  I mean, &quot;pre-emma andrew&quot; compared to &quot;now-andrew&quot; and that&#039;s really what you think?

Listen, Im sorry that I cant come to adelaide.  Im sorry because it was never a viable option for me and I should have realised it immediately and not built up our hopes only to dash them now.  I just wanted it so badly I was unwilling to acknowledge a bunch of facts that were right in front of my face that said this is not viable, and I did that for a long time.  Im sorry, equivocation seems to be a bad character flaw of mine. Now I do acknowledge these facts and I am comfortable with my decision to go to canberra.  Even though it sucks that we cant be together.  Life&#039;s a bitch.

Listen, like I said the internet is the worst way to deal with these sort of things so that is all Im going to say in this message.  I guess we will have to talk about it next time we meet.  Don&#039;t write back ok?  You have been incredibly hurtful to the woman I love, and I am fking pissed off about it.  for fk&#039;s sake damian.  You really need to think about what you think you know about em and I and then try to figure out where the fk did all that come from??  That&#039;s what em and I are trying to do. bro.

Hey Bro,

Please do me a favour of reading this message to yourself, and delete it afterwards... do not show/share with Em... for reasons you will see soon. brother to brother.

I was really disappointed with your choice, was sooo looking forward to doing so much with you here in Adelaide. Not just cricket, but everything... I totally believe you have the right to put yourself first, you&#039;ve worked really hard for it.

I also dont want you to share with this Em because I dont think she&#039;s the right girl for you. She was at one time, but I dont think thats the case any longer... This will be the only time I ever say it, because I love you as a brother, but each of us makes our own choices.

We have a history of doing this... When I was with Leesh, I thought she was the only one for me, even after more and more things popped up wrong... I know Em helped you, and was right for you at one time, but I cant stomach the way she talks to you sometime... thats not loving, its mean and controlling. But even when Leesh and I broke up, I still would have done anything to keep together, and that was wrong too.... I knew that from Dads hopeless relationships... but the heart doesnt always listen to the head.

First with that awful Helen who attacked us, his family, and Dad just tried to make peace and keep the relationship going, rather than stand up for himself because he was so scared that there was no one else for him. And she still broke up with him after all that. With some women, if you dont put yourself first, they step all over you, or guilt you to control you.

Dad should have seen this coming though as he had to live with it for years through the treatment he got with Trish, Ace&#039;s wife. Trish hated Dad for years, and it kept the two brothers apart?!?!?!?!? How the hell did two grown brothers let it come to that?

And on Dad, yes, he will be working til he retires, but its the choices he makes now that is hurting him... but he continues to make the same choice again and again, but I love him and will continue to be in his ear, and be there for him. Anyone outside the family who insults him in my presence is risking a broken jaw... poking him with a stick .. (thats our job;)

And there is no way in hell you will be where Dad is starting at 35.... I&#039;m at 38 and also have nothing, but, Im saving now, doing my degree, and on 90k at the moment.... that will increase, engineers in energy and resources, defence make heaps. We have 30 plus years of income at over 100K a year.... Dont let fear influence your decision.

I was also looking forward to hooking you up with a hottie here in Adelaide... one thats nice, cashed up, sexy, and did I mention nice? Sorry for saying it, but I will never apologise for wanting the best for my brother...... I only say this through painful experience myself, but I could have never been this happy before, and it took a few girls to find out what I wanted.No one I know is still with their first serious partner. And I kind of have introductory access to a large pool of girls now that I cant use for myself anymore ;)

Anyway.... whatever you decide, Im still your brother. I really have been imagining you and me doing stuff next year together, and am disappointed, but I&#039;ll get over it.  But Just ask yourself if you&#039;d be making the same choice if Em wasnt with you...

Anyway read, digest, and please delete (not beacause Im ashamed of this, but this is just for you). I really do miss you, and Adelaide was gonna be amazing. Its hard to say these things to family, Lel has the same problem with her Brother and a wife thats not such a great partner to him... how do you deal with such things, or even say your bit?

Prawn friend? Thats no way to talk to your big bro who can show you how to survive Adelaide.... you know we bury ppl in barrels who upset us here dont you? ;)

So whats the plan? Back late Nov, here in Adl early Dec? Em coming too?

I&#039;ve just pasted in a reply I wrote to an earlier question you had about Radelaide below...


Hi Bro,
 
Gotta say super excited about you getting the job, and having you here in Radelaide! (Its not Adelaide anymore ;)
 
Couple of things to know about Adelaide;
 
1.    Public transport sucks, as in its just not there, unless you want to go to the city.
 
2.    No public transport to the base. There is a bus apparently, but not at any useable time. Youre def gonna need a car.
 
3.    You can ride your bike to work, but everyone who rides their pushbike has had at least one dangerous incident with the bogans around the base (one dude was knocked off his bike by a carload of bogans who drove up quietly behind him and hit him with a peice of 2x4 timber...broke some vertebre in his back) .... I would&#039;nt after what Ive seen and heard. The gym on base which you will have access to is awesome enough.
 
4.    I can hook you up with pretty much everything you need (if you want)... car, furniture, place, everything! due to local connections, and heaps of stuff on offer at the end of the year due to posting cycle. And I can get a van to help move you in.
 
5.    The best place I&#039;ve lived in Adelaide is where I am now... super easy, quick and hassle free access to the base, beach right nearby, train line into the city, great food, cheap rental prices and a better class of bogan ;)
 
6.    No accomodation on base. Not even for Airforce. The Army came in and they kicked everyone out. And you really dont want to live in one of the suburbs near the base.... its not only that its boganville(it is)... it just sucks ass..
 
7.    Oh, the best cafe that makes its own pies is just at the end of our street too!
 
Anyhow, stuff to think off, but be cool and safe, cant wait to see you here, and will be great helping you get set up :)

Dear Friends,

About a month ago I committed to the 9km Bridge Run with CanToo on 16 September to support Cure Cancer Australia and Cancer research. Those of you who know me well will know this isn&#039;t the greatest distance for me; however the challenge to fundraise a minimum of $800 is something new. I&#039;m halfway through the 10 weeks of training now, and it&#039;s time to get the $$ flowing. 

I&#039;ll spare you the &#039;we&#039;ve all been touched by cancer&#039; jazz, it&#039;s almost become an understatement these days. Basically, I&#039;m fundraising, I&#039;d love any help you could swing my way for a great cause, and karma will do the rest.

Here&#039;s my fundraising page:http://cantoobsrf2012.gofundraise.com.au/page/RachaelChadwick

And if you&#039;d like more info on CanToo and Cure Cancer Australia, have a look here:

Big love,

Rach x

Help needed!

To all my Canberra friends,

two friends of mine are moving to canberra in two weeks. They need a place to live for the first two months whilst they get acquainted with Canberra and work out where they want to live and find an house. They are public servants, in the mid 30&#039;s  both finishing their masters and hail from Sydney. 

They are not looking for a house to move in to permanently, just a place for a few months. The first week they will live in my floor as I don&#039;t have a second bedroom but since they mean the world to me, I want to help them out as much as I can. 

So if YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW is looking for a short-term flatmate or have a spare room and want to make a little extra cash for a few months from mid feb, let me know.

If you can&#039;t help, still keep your ears open, if you hear of something, let me know as well.

Thanks and I hope everyone&#039;s summer is going well. If you are a teacher, enjoy your last week of freedom!

Hi Robbie,

This is the walking tour I was talking about, it is awesome. Don&#039;t make the mistake of going on the free one as it is boring! http://www.brewersberlintours.com/

This is the bierbike tour I mentioned which might be fun for the buck&#039;s party http://www.bierbike-berlin.de/fileadmin/berlin/Dateien/bierbike_english.pdf

Don&#039;t forget to remind us of when your 30th birthday is so we can come down.

Dear all, Dan is turning 34, he has outlived people who died at 33 like Van Gogh, Eva Braun and of course Jesus. As he has outlived people who cut their own ears, were forced to commit suicide by their petty dictatorial boyfriend or crucified, he would like to go celebrate on Saturday 14th of June. You have all made the list of people whom he likes to drink, eat, laugh and be merry. So come do that! We were thinking about having dinner at 7 pm Francisco&#039;s in Manuka http://www.franciscos.com.au/menu.php (its Mexican food and it has some vegetarian options although not many) Then we want to go have drinks at Polit bar which we stumbled upon a few weeks ago and fell in love with http://www.politbar.co/ If you would like to come for part or all of that evening, let me know so I can book a table. We hope to see you there, Rou

damian, listen I cant really talk to you at the moment.  I can&#039;t believe how you fucked this up, and i have no idea how you could fix it.  Even if you wanted to, which all your bullshit justification indicates to the negative.

I mean, just think about the consequences of your little bitchburst...no we are not coming to xmas, and sorry bud you won&#039;t be at my graduation.  So you tell me, what other family events will you or emma have to miss? 

And you have no idea what you are talking about, I mean honestly you haven&#039;t spent 1 week with emma and me over the last 2 years?  What the fuck have you directly seen??  You really feel like you know us well enough to make those shitty judgements?

Listen, Im sick of seeing these pointless messages on my facebook.  I asked you not to write back re this and you ignored me.  If you want to talk about it you can get my mobile number. 

thanks for the fucking birthday wishes.

Happy Birthday Bro!
 
I know we have a lot to talk about, which we will, but wanted to say Happy Bday anyway.
 
I absolutely do apologise for any pain I&#039;ve caused you and Emma, it honestly wasnt my intention.
 
I talked to the rest of the family about this, as they all knew about it anyway.
 
I honestly dont hate Emma.

I was only concerned for you, based on things I have directly seen for myself, but it did turn out badly, and for that I really do apologise.
 
Cant express how disappointed that youre not coming to Adelaide, but anyway click on the link to see who&#039;s the best bowler in my division...

bro.  To answer one of your questions, choosing facebook or the internet to deal with such things as this is the worst way to do so.  Thats because you have no control over who reads what you&#039;ve written.  So yeah, I have the tablet that em and I both use set up so that notifications for both our email accounts, and facebook messages, get displayed automatically.  So yeah em read that message...could&#039;nt not read it actually...and you have hurt her incredibly.  

She loves you dude, and she had no idea you felt that way.  I had some idea, from some implications you made casually. I didnt like those implications btw, I wish I had said something cause maybe you wouldn&#039;t have written this. But never mind me you have hurt em so bad I doubt she will ever be able to talk to you again.    Don&#039;t know what you can do about that.  Will probably end up keeping us brothers apart in future I imagine.

Damian, nothing you said was justified. Do you really know so little about our relationship? But as you say you arent embarrassed about saying this stuff.  I actually have no idea how to respond to your message, you don&#039;t seem to have much respect for me.  You feel I let em walk all over me?  You feel I let her make all the important decisions for us?  You think Im putting my career second because em tells me to?  You compared her to helen??? You think she is bad for me?  After all the positive influences em has had on my life??  I mean, &quot;pre-emma andrew&quot; compared to &quot;now-andrew&quot; and that&#039;s really what you think?

Listen, Im sorry that I cant come to adelaide.  Im sorry because it was never a viable option for me and I should have realised it immediately and not built up our hopes only to dash them now.  I just wanted it so badly I was unwilling to acknowledge a bunch of facts that were right in front of my face that said this is not viable, and I did that for a long time.  Im sorry, equivocation seems to be a bad character flaw of mine. Now I do acknowledge these facts and I am comfortable with my decision to go to canberra.  Even though it sucks that we cant be together.  Life&#039;s a bitch.

Listen, like I said the internet is the worst way to deal with these sort of things so that is all Im going to say in this message.  I guess we will have to talk about it next time we meet.  Don&#039;t write back ok?  You have been incredibly hurtful to the woman I love, and I am fking pissed off about it.  for fk&#039;s sake damian.  You really need to think about what you think you know about em and I and then try to figure out where the fk did all that come from??  That&#039;s what em and I are trying to do. bro.

Hey Bro,

Please do me a favour of reading this message to yourself, and delete it afterwards... do not show/share with Em... for reasons you will see soon. brother to brother.

I was really disappointed with your choice, was sooo looking forward to doing so much with you here in Adelaide. Not just cricket, but everything... I totally believe you have the right to put yourself first, you&#039;ve worked really hard for it.

I also dont want you to share with this Em because I dont think she&#039;s the right girl for you. She was at one time, but I dont think thats the case any longer... This will be the only time I ever say it, because I love you as a brother, but each of us makes our own choices.

We have a history of doing this... When I was with Leesh, I thought she was the only one for me, even after more and more things popped up wrong... I know Em helped you, and was right for you at one time, but I cant stomach the way she talks to you sometime... thats not loving, its mean and controlling. But even when Leesh and I broke up, I still would have done anything to keep together, and that was wrong too.... I knew that from Dads hopeless relationships... but the heart doesnt always listen to the head.

First with that awful Helen who attacked us, his family, and Dad just tried to make peace and keep the relationship going, rather than stand up for himself because he was so scared that there was no one else for him. And she still broke up with him after all that. With some women, if you dont put yourself first, they step all over you, or guilt you to control you.

Dad should have seen this coming though as he had to live with it for years through the treatment he got with Trish, Ace&#039;s wife. Trish hated Dad for years, and it kept the two brothers apart?!?!?!?!? How the hell did two grown brothers let it come to that?

And on Dad, yes, he will be working til he retires, but its the choices he makes now that is hurting him... but he continues to make the same choice again and again, but I love him and will continue to be in his ear, and be there for him. Anyone outside the family who insults him in my presence is risking a broken jaw... poking him with a stick .. (thats our job;)

And there is no way in hell you will be where Dad is starting at 35.... I&#039;m at 38 and also have nothing, but, Im saving now, doing my degree, and on 90k at the moment.... that will increase, engineers in energy and resources, defence make heaps. We have 30 plus years of income at over 100K a year.... Dont let fear influence your decision.

I was also looking forward to hooking you up with a hottie here in Adelaide... one thats nice, cashed up, sexy, and did I mention nice? Sorry for saying it, but I will never apologise for wanting the best for my brother...... I only say this through painful experience myself, but I could have never been this happy before, and it took a few girls to find out what I wanted.No one I know is still with their first serious partner. And I kind of have introductory access to a large pool of girls now that I cant use for myself anymore ;)

Anyway.... whatever you decide, Im still your brother. I really have been imagining you and me doing stuff next year together, and am disappointed, but I&#039;ll get over it.  But Just ask yourself if you&#039;d be making the same choice if Em wasnt with you...

Anyway read, digest, and please delete (not beacause Im ashamed of this, but this is just for you). I really do miss you, and Adelaide was gonna be amazing. Its hard to say these things to family, Lel has the same problem with her Brother and a wife thats not such a great partner to him... how do you deal with such things, or even say your bit?

Prawn friend? Thats no way to talk to your big bro who can show you how to survive Adelaide.... you know we bury ppl in barrels who upset us here dont you? ;)

So whats the plan? Back late Nov, here in Adl early Dec? Em coming too?

I&#039;ve just pasted in a reply I wrote to an earlier question you had about Radelaide below...


Hi Bro,
 
Gotta say super excited about you getting the job, and having you here in Radelaide! (Its not Adelaide anymore ;)
 
Couple of things to know about Adelaide;
 
1.    Public transport sucks, as in its just not there, unless you want to go to the city.
 
2.    No public transport to the base. There is a bus apparently, but not at any useable time. Youre def gonna need a car.
 
3.    You can ride your bike to work, but everyone who rides their pushbike has had at least one dangerous incident with the bogans around the base (one dude was knocked off his bike by a carload of bogans who drove up quietly behind him and hit him with a peice of 2x4 timber...broke some vertebre in his back) .... I would&#039;nt after what Ive seen and heard. The gym on base which you will have access to is awesome enough.
 
4.    I can hook you up with pretty much everything you need (if you want)... car, furniture, place, everything! due to local connections, and heaps of stuff on offer at the end of the year due to posting cycle. And I can get a van to help move you in.
 
5.    The best place I&#039;ve lived in Adelaide is where I am now... super easy, quick and hassle free access to the base, beach right nearby, train line into the city, great food, cheap rental prices and a better class of bogan ;)
 
6.    No accomodation on base. Not even for Airforce. The Army came in and they kicked everyone out. And you really dont want to live in one of the suburbs near the base.... its not only that its boganville(it is)... it just sucks ass..
 
7.    Oh, the best cafe that makes its own pies is just at the end of our street too!
 
Anyhow, stuff to think off, but be cool and safe, cant wait to see you here, and will be great helping you get set up :)

Dear Friends,

About a month ago I committed to the 9km Bridge Run with CanToo on 16 September to support Cure Cancer Australia and Cancer research. Those of you who know me well will know this isn&#039;t the greatest distance for me; however the challenge to fundraise a minimum of $800 is something new. I&#039;m halfway through the 10 weeks of training now, and it&#039;s time to get the $$ flowing. 

I&#039;ll spare you the &#039;we&#039;ve all been touched by cancer&#039; jazz, it&#039;s almost become an understatement these days. Basically, I&#039;m fundraising, I&#039;d love any help you could swing my way for a great cause, and karma will do the rest.

Here&#039;s my fundraising page:http://cantoobsrf2012.gofundraise.com.au/page/RachaelChadwick

And if you&#039;d like more info on CanToo and Cure Cancer Australia, have a look here:

Big love,

Rach x

Help needed!

To all my Canberra friends,

two friends of mine are moving to canberra in two weeks. They need a place to live for the first two months whilst they get acquainted with Canberra and work out where they want to live and find an house. They are public servants, in the mid 30&#039;s  both finishing their masters and hail from Sydney. 

They are not looking for a house to move in to permanently, just a place for a few months. The first week they will live in my floor as I don&#039;t have a second bedroom but since they mean the world to me, I want to help them out as much as I can. 

So if YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW is looking for a short-term flatmate or have a spare room and want to make a little extra cash for a few months from mid feb, let me know.

If you can&#039;t help, still keep your ears open, if you hear of something, let me know as well.

Thanks and I hope everyone&#039;s summer is going well. If you are a teacher, enjoy your last week of freedom!

Hi Robbie,

This is the walking tour I was talking about, it is awesome. Don&#039;t make the mistake of going on the free one as it is boring! http://www.brewersberlintours.com/

This is the bierbike tour I mentioned which might be fun for the buck&#039;s party http://www.bierbike-berlin.de/fileadmin/berlin/Dateien/bierbike_english.pdf

Don&#039;t forget to remind us of when your 30th birthday is so we can come down.

Dear all, Dan is turning 34, he has outlived people who died at 33 like Van Gogh, Eva Braun and of course Jesus. As he has outlived people who cut their own ears, were forced to commit suicide by their petty dictatorial boyfriend or crucified, he would like to go celebrate on Saturday 14th of June. You have all made the list of people whom he likes to drink, eat, laugh and be merry. So come do that! We were thinking about having dinner at 7 pm Francisco&#039;s in Manuka http://www.franciscos.com.au/menu.php (its Mexican food and it has some vegetarian options although not many) Then we want to go have drinks at Polit bar which we stumbled upon a few weeks ago and fell in love with http://www.politbar.co/ If you would like to come for part or all of that evening, let me know so I can book a table. We hope to see you there, Rou
